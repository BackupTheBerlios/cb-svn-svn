The png2ico executable in this directory is not part of my work, neither is it meant for your use or distribution.
It is merely in the project folder as a product of my lazyness (so I don't need to manually copy it around, don't need
to care about PATH on different PCs, and can have it automatically run during pre-compilation).

If you want a version of this program for your use (you probably do because it is great), please get a pristine copy
from the author (see above URL).
